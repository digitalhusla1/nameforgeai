# NameForgeAI Deployment Guide

## GitHub Deployment âœ… COMPLETED
Your code has been successfully pushed to GitHub!

## Netlify Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect to GitHub and select your `nameforgeai` repository
4. Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Once your site is deployed, you need to add these environment variables in Netlify:

**In your Netlify dashboard:**
1. Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
2. Add the following variables:

```
ADMIN_CODE=your_secure_admin_code
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key  
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_replicate_token
GEMINI_API_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Deploy and Test
1. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site
2. Access your site at: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
3. Test the name generation functionality
4. Access admin panel at: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin.html`

### 4. Admin Panel Usage
1. Navigate to `/admin.html`
2. Enter your admin code
3. Configure your API keys
4. Click "Save" to store them (they'll be saved to environment variables)
5. Test the generation functionality

## Important Notes

### Security
- âœ… `.env` file is properly excluded from git
- âœ… Encryption is disabled for simpler deployment
- âœ… Admin panel validates and saves API keys properly
- âœ… Environment variables are secure on Netlify

### File Structure
```
Essential files for deployment:
â”œâ”€â”€ public/           (Frontend files)
â”œâ”€â”€ netlify/functions/ (Serverless functions)
â”œâ”€â”€ netlify.toml      (Netlify configuration)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      (Dependencies)
â””â”€â”€ .env.example      (Template for environment variables)
```

### API Endpoints
- `/` - Main application
- `/admin.html` - Admin panel
- `/api/*` - Name generation API
- `/api/admin-panel` - Admin panel API

## Troubleshooting

### If API calls fail:
1. Check environment variables in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify API keys are correctly formatted
3. Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

### If admin panel doesn't work:
1. Verify ADMIN_CODE is set in environment variables
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure you're accessing `/admin.html` not `/admin`

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Test all functionality on the live site
2. Save your Netlify site URL
3. Update any documentation with the live URL
4. Consider setting up a custom domain if needed

Your site is ready for deployment! ðŸš€
